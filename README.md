# Project - Programming and Scripting

This project is my analysis of the Iris dataset for the Module Programming and Scripting of the Course Data Analytics in [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).

This README follows the the documentation from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) regarding README files.

## What the project does

This repository includes:
1. this README to explain the purpose of this repository;
2. [iris folder](iris) with the data set downloaded from the [study](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris);
3. a [Python script](analysis.py), that loads the data and outputs it in a presentable way through summary of variables, visual representation and correlation;
4. a [notebook](iris.ipynb) with explanation of the Python script and approach of the data set;
5. a [txt file](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/pands-project/blob/b176e1d0cc1c133d192bd1a79386e40216491a59/Summary%20of%20each%20variable.txt) generated with the Python script, containing the summary of the variables;
6. images with the plotted data in histograms, bars and scatter plots, all generated with Python script;
7. a .gitignore as standard.

## Why the project is useful

While doing this work, I learned many essential skills that I need to develop in order to become a data analyst. It helped me in how to use data sets, to explore some of the vast tools available in Python to manipulate and present the data, and to go deep in the observations of variables to describe them and maybe create a possible association between them.

## How users can get started with the project

To run the codes, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) need to be installed to run these programs.
